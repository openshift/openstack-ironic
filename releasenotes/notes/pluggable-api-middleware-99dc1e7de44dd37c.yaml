    Adds support for pluggable WSGI middleware via stevedore entry points.
    Operators can now add custom request processing (validation, logging,
    rate limiting, etc.) without maintaining patches against Ironic source.
    Middleware are registered via the ``ironic.api.middleware`` entry point
    namespace and enabled via the new ``[api] middleware`` configuration
    option. See the `Custom API Middleware
    <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/api-middleware.html>`_
    documentation for details.
