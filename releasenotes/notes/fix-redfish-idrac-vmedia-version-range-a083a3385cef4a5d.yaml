    Fixes an issue where the ``redfish-virtual-media`` interface is using version
    ranges with Dell iDRAC BMCs to report compatibility. Dell has changed the
    versioning structure for iDRAC10s which triggered the error. That being said,
    it appears the iDRAC10s are also incompatible as well. The error message
    now clearly indicates what versions are known to work with the stock
    redfish virtual media support. Users should instead use the idrac variant
    boot interface.
