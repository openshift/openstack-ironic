    Adds support for NFS and CIFS/SMB transport protocols for Redfish VirtualMedia
    boot with automatic protocol detection from BMC capabilities. The driver now
    automatically detects supported transport protocols (HTTP, NFS, CIFS) from the
    BMC's VirtualMedia capabilities and selects the best option based on BMC support
    and configuration. Configure NFS or CIFS shares using
    ``[nfs]base_url``/``share_path`` or ``[cifs]base_url``/
    ``share_path``. Protocol selection can be overridden per-node using
    ``driver_info[vmedia_transport_protocol]``.

    .. note::
       Ironic does not run or manage any NFS/CIFS services. Operators are
       responsible for setting up the file share and ensuring it is reachable
       from the BMC. Ironic copies boot images to the configured share path
       and provides the URL to the BMC.
