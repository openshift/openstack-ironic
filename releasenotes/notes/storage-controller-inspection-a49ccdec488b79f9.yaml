    The Redfish out-of-band inspection now collects storage controller and
    drive information from the Redfish Storage resources. For each storage
    resource, the following data is collected:

    * **Storage resource**: ``id`` and ``name`` from the top-level Storage
      resource.
    * **Sub-controllers** (from the deprecated ``StorageControllers``
      list): ``member_id``, ``name``, ``raid_types``, ``speed_gbps``,
      ``controller_protocols``, ``device_protocols``, and ``status``.
    * **Drives**: ``name``, ``size`` (capacity in bytes), ``id``,
      ``media_type``, ``protocol``, ``serial_number``, ``manufacturer``,
      ``model``, ``revision``, and ``status``.

    This information is stored in the ``inventory['storage_controllers']``
    field of the inspection data and can be used by inspection rules to
    configure RAID or make scheduling decisions based on available storage
    hardware.
