    Adds an experimental ``reattach_networking`` service step to the Neutron
    network interface. This service step allows operators to refresh network
    port bindings on active bare metal instances without requiring a reboot
    or IPA deployment. This is useful for advanced networking scenarios such
    as VXLAN topology changes or network infrastructure migrations.

    The service step can be invoked using::

      openstack baremetal node service <node-uuid> \
        --service-steps '[{"interface": "network", "step": "reattach_networking"}]'

    This step does not require booting IPA (``requires_ramdisk=False``) and
    is only available when using ``network_interface=neutron``.
