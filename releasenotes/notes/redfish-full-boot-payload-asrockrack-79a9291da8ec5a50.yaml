    Improved Redfish compatibility with ASRock Rack servers by updating how
    boot mode and boot device settings are applied.

    Previously, calls to `set_boot_device` and `set_boot_mode` only included
    minimal parameters (e.g., `BootOverrideTarget` and `BootOverrideMode`), which
    were insufficient for certain vendor implementations like ASRockRack.

    This fix updates the Redfish driver to send the full payload, including
    `BootSourceOverrideEnabled`, `BootSourceOverrideTarget`, `BootSourceOverrideMode`,
    ensuring better compliance and reliability on these platforms.
