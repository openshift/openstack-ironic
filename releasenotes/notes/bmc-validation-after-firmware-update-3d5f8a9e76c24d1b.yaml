    Reduces likelihood of intermittent firmware upgrade failures by adding
    comprehensive BMC state validation after firmware upgrades for the
    Redfish driver. After a firmware update task completes successfully, Ironic
    now validates that BMC resources (System, Manager, and NetworkAdapters) are
    consistently available before proceeding with subsequent operations.

    This change improves firmware update reliability by requiring a
    configurable number of consecutive successful responses from the BMC
    resources. The validation process helps ensure the BMC has fully stabilized
    after firmware updates before marking the operation as complete.

    New configuration options in the ``[redfish]`` section:

    * ``firmware_update_required_successes`` - Number of consecutive successful
      responses required to consider BMC validation successful (default: 3),
      0 disables validation
    * ``firmware_update_validation_interval`` - Time in seconds to wait between
      validation attempts (default: 30)
    * ``firmware_update_resource_validation_timeout`` - Maximum time in seconds
      to wait for BMC resources to stabilize (default: 300), setting it to 0
      disables validation.
